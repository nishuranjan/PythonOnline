1) IF Statement Exercise: 

Assign 8 to the variable x and 15 to the variable y.

In the same cell, create 2 conditional statements.

Let the first one print “At least one of the conditions is satisfied.” if x is greater than 3 or y is even.

Let the second one print “Neither condition is satisfied.” if x is less than or equal to 3 and y is odd.

Change the values assigned to x and y and re-run the cell to verify your code still works.

2) Write a function to convert a numerical grade to a letter grade, ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’ or ‘F’, where the cutoffs for ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’ are 90, 80, 70, and 60 respectively.
