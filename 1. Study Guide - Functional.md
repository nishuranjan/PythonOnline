we will take a much closer look at:

1. Variables - in particular that they are just symbols pointing to objects in memory

2. Namespaces and scope

3. Python's numeric types

4. Python boolean type - there's more to a simple or statement than you might think!

5. Run-time vs compile-time and how that affects function defaults, decorators, importing modules, etc

6. Functions in general (including lambdas)

7. Functional programming techniques (such as map, reduce, filter, zip, etc)

8. Closures

9. Decorators

10. Imports, modules and packages

11. Tuples as data structures

12. Named tuples
