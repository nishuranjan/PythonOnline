# Comfortable with the basic Python language including:

1. variables and simple types such as str , bool , int  and float  types
2. for  and while  loops
3. if...else...  statements
4. defining functions (using the def  statement)
5. writing simple classes using the class  keyword and the __init__  function
6. using simple lists , tuples , dictionaries  and sets 

# You should also:

1. have Python 3.6 (or higher) installed on your system 
2. be able to write and run simple Python programs using either:
    2.1. the command line, or
    2.2. a favorite IDE (such as VS Code and PyCharm), 
    2.3. or Jupyter notebooks (which I use throughout this course)
	

COOL....
