# PythonOnline

# In-depth look at:

sequences

iterables

iterators

generators

comprehensions

context managers

generator based coroutines

I will show you exactly how iteration works in Python - from the sequence protocol, to the iterable and iterator protocols, and how we can write our own sequence and iterable data types.

We'll go into some detail to explain sequence slicing and how slicing relates to ranges.

We look at comprehensions in detail as well and I will show you how list comprehensions are actually closures and have their own scope, and the reason why subtle bugs sometimes creep in to list comprehensions that we might not expect.

We'll take a deep dive into the itertools module and look at all the functions available there and how useful (but overlooked!) they can be.

We also look at generator functions, their relation to iterators, and their comprehension counterparts (generator expressions).

Context managers, an often overlooked construct in Python, is covered in detail too. There we will learn how to create and leverage our own context managers and understand the relationship between context managers and generator functions.

Finally, we'll look at how we can use generators to create coroutines.

Each section is followed by a project designed to put into practice what you learn throughout the course.
